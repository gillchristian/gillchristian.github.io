In December last year I created the proof of concept (PoC) for an idea I have
that seems a bit crazy, at least to me now. It’s a tool to search TypeScript
functions and methods by their type signature.

Since I am quite happy with this PoC I decided to commit to the project and work
on developing a real useful version.

I plan to share my experience in this devlog because I want to keep track of how
the project evolves, what I learn and the things I discover along the way. Also,
I guess it will be interesting and useful to others too. To get started I think
it makes sense to share how I came up with this idea, what I’ve done already and
what is ahead.

## The crazy idea

I have been learning about functional programming for a while now. I started
with [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming][1] and
then went on to try out different languages, Elm, Haskell, Reason, Clojure,
Scheme. Which is something I enjoy on itself and encourage you to do too.
Learning other languages will give you new approaches and ways to solve problems
that you can bring back to the language/s you use.

While playing around with Haskell for last year’s [Advent of Code][2] I used
[Hoogle][3] (yeah, Hoogle, with H) a lot.

> libraries on Stackage by either function name, or by approximate type
> signature.

[Stackage][4] is a package manager for Haskell, with the guarantee that packages
will work with each other.

Hoogle turned out to be a really useful tool during development. Which begged
the question, why isn’t there such thing for TypeScript? I work with TypeScript
on a daily basis and I think it would be a really good addition to the available
tools.

The closest thing I found is [Open Symbol by name][5] in VS Code.

## The proof of concept

I shared the idea with my friend [Franco][6], who is much more pragmatic than I
am, and he told my “Why don’t you build a PoC and see if it makes sense?”.

As a good PoC it had to be as simple as possible. A way to extract the type
signatures from all the exported functions in a local directory and search them
through a simple UI.

You can find it [here][7]. For now there is not much you can do with it and
documentation is very basic.

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>

By the way, I should give credit for the name, `ts-earch`, to Franco.

## Open questions

Developing the PoC convinced me that it is an idea worth working on. But, to be
honest, it also left me with more questions than answers.

- Should I use actual TypeScript type signatures for search? Or should I come up
  with a simpler DSL? In Haskell that is not so much of a problem. Let’s compare
  the signature of `compose` in both languages.

```haskell
compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```

```ts
type Compose = <A, B, C>(f: (b: B) => C, g: (a: A) => B) => (a: A) => C
```

- What about type inference? Say we have a `Person` type, and a function that
  accepts a person, defined as:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string
}

const getName = (p: Person) => p.name
```

Searching for `(x: { name: string }) => string` should return `getName` even
though the type matches implicitly. How to solve that, I have no idea yet.

- What is the best way to index the types for searching them?
- How to weigh and match types when searching?

These are a few of the open questions I have that I will have to solve. And I am
sure there will be more questions along the way.

## One step at a time

To get started it makes sense to have something that people can use and play
around with. My short term goal is to adjust a few things and deploy `ts-earch`
with all the [DefinitelyTyped][8] packages available for search.

If you have any questions, suggestions or would like to collaborate on the
project feel free to [reach out to me on Twitter][9].

Stay tuned for more updates =D

commenting and sharing or give up and publish on Medium.
